Constructing a self-made database.
DB is a relational DB, row-oriented.

Advantages of row-oriented DB: Support for I/O efficiency in per-record operations. 
Disadvantages: Heavy aggregations and less efficient calculations on the data.

DB is particularly fast in these operations and less focused on the efficiency of aggregation operations and per column operations.

The recommended data type for working with this DB is numbers, characters, strings of fixed length and such.

Special thanks to ADVA and Elevation team and all the mentors from 8-200!
